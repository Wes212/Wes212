- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wes212
- 👀 I’m interested in building the base layer for every crypto to be built upon, an issue that I have seen is the unit of account in Bitcoin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this big issue, a paper has been written by myself which could be shared on Signal platform, you could judge, argue and finally, if it touches your philosophy, to build this new tech.
- 📫 You could reach me, first on Telegram to finally integrate a group in Signal.
- @TellAsmar; that is my telegram. Do not see this post with your ego, but with your person, take a look, at least. Thank you.
